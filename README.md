# 📚 Library ChatBot

Library ChatBot is a Python-based chatbot application that allows users to **manage a library system** through simple conversational commands.  
It connects to a **SQLite database (`books.db`)** and supports operations such as **adding books, deleting books, searching, and retrieving details**.  

This project demonstrates how a chatbot can be integrated with a database to handle real-world use cases like managing digital library resources.
